## Modified Files for Production Support

### HTML Files

- hoteleditor.html
- photo-viewer.html

### JavaScript Files
- **js/tracking.js**: Updated to handle production configuration properly

## Production Detection

The application now includes logic to detect if it's running in the production environment:
- Checks if the hostname is "premierfix.uk"
- Conditionally loads the production Firebase configuration when running in production
- Uses appropriate Firebase project based on environment

## Firebase Production Setup

Instructions created for:
- Setting up a new Firebase project for production
- Configuring Firebase Hosting for the production project
- Connecting the custom domain "premierfix.uk"
- DNS configuration with Fasthosts

## Ignored Files for Production

The following files and patterns are excluded from production deployment:
- tracking-new.html
- js/tracking-new.js
- All .bak* files
- README.md
- detailsupdate.txt
- Node modules
- Hidden files

## Security Improvements

- Added console warnings about sensitive information
- Created a framework for separating development and production environments
- Ensured Firebase configurations are properly isolated

## Summary of Benefits

1. **Clean Separation**: Development and production environments are now cleanly separated
2. **Domain-Based Configuration**: The correct Firebase project is automatically selected based on the domain
3. **Deployment Automation**: Simplified deployment process with helper scripts
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for deployment and domain setup
5. **File Cleanup**: Renamed files for clarity and consistency
6. **Security**: Better isolation of sensitive configuration data

*Note: While these changes prepare the application for production, the actual Firebase project "PremierFix-Prod" still needs to be created, and the firebase-config-prod.js file should be updated with the actual production credentials before deployment.*
